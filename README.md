**Uy, Kape!** is a coffee-ordering system for _coffee prosumers_ who want to give **visitors** to their **home** a fancy online ordering system with professional branding. All menu items are free, the intent is to give the coffee barista a way to track guest orders based on what is available at home for the day.

## Vibe Coding

This app is **100% vibe coded!** using [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com). We do this mostly by following the [plan-implement-run pattern](https://raffertyuy.com/raztype/vibe-coding-plan-implement-run/).

This starts with writing a task objective in [scratch.md](/scratch.md) and then running `/1-plan #file:scratch.md` in GitHub Copilot Chat.

For more details, read the [VIBE CODING GUIDE](./VIBE_CODING_GUIDE.md).
