## Project Overview

Uy, Kape! is a free coffee ordering system designed for home environments where guests can easily place coffee orders and administrators can manage the menu and order queue in real-time. The application emphasizes simplicity, modern design, and seamless user experience across both guest and administrator workflows.

- Real-time order management and updates
- Mobile-responsive design
- Light theme only (no dark mode)
- Free coffee ordering (no payment processing)

## System Architecture

### Application Structure
The system consists of two main access points from a welcome landing page:

1. **"Order Here"** â†’ [Guest Module](#guest-module)
2. **"Barista Administration"** â†’ [Barista Admin Module](#barista-admin-module)

### Technical Foundation
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions)
