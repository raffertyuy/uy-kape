# Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria that all development work must meet before being considered complete in the Uy, Kape! project. These standards ensure quality, maintainability, and consistency across all features and implementations.

## **Code Quality Standards**

### **Testing Requirements**

- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All new code has comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for all new/modified code
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Critical user flows have integration tests
- [ ] **All Tests Pass**: 100% of unit tests and integration tests must pass
- [ ] **Test Documentation**: Complex test scenarios are documented with clear descriptions

### **Code Standards**

- [ ] **Linting**: Zero ESLint errors and warnings (maximum 5 warnings allowed in CI)
- [ ] **Type Safety**: All TypeScript code properly typed with no `any` types unless justified
- [ ] **Code Style**: Code follows established patterns and conventions in the codebase
- [ ] **Performance**: No obvious performance regressions or inefficiencies

## **Functionality Requirements**

### **Feature Completeness**

- [ ] **Requirements Met**: All specified requirements from the feature specification are implemented
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Common edge cases and error scenarios are handled

- [ ] **Real-time Features**: Supabase real-time functionality works correctly where applicable

### **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

- [ ] **Mobile Responsive**: All UI components work correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Features work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Basic accessibility standards are met (WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines)

## **Security & Data**

### **Security Standards**

- [ ] **Authentication**: Password protection works correctly where required
- [ ] **Data Validation**: All user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information
- [ ] **RLS Policies**: Supabase Row Level Security policies are properly configured

### **Data Integrity**

- [ ] **Database Schema**: Database changes are properly migrated and documented
- [ ] **Data Consistency**: Real-time updates maintain data consistency across clients
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of database connection issues and errors

## **Documentation Standards**

### **Code Documentation**

- [ ] **Complex Logic**: Non-obvious code sections have clear comments
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Public functions and components are documented
- [ ] **Type Definitions**: Custom types are well-defined and documented

### **Feature Documentation**

- [ ] **User Guides**: End-user documentation updated for new features
- [ ] **Technical Specs**: Implementation details documented for complex features
- [ ] **Change Log**: Significant changes are documented in appropriate files

## **UI/UX Standards**

### **Visual Design**

- [ ] **Design Consistency**: UI follows established design patterns and coffee theme
- [ ] **Tailwind Standards**: CSS follows Tailwind utility-first approach
- [ ] **Component Reusability**: Common UI patterns use shared components
- [ ] **Loading States**: Appropriate loading indicators for async operations

### **User Experience**

- [ ] **Intuitive Navigation**: User flows are logical and easy to follow
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for users
- [ ] **Success Feedback**: Appropriate confirmation messages for user actions
- [ ] **Performance**: Page load times and interactions feel responsive

## **Technical Standards**

### **Build & Deployment**

- [ ] **Clean Builds**: `npm run build` completes without errors or warnings
- [ ] **Development Mode**: `npm run dev` works correctly with hot reload
- [ ] **Bundle Optimization**: No unnecessary dependencies or bloated bundles
- [ ] **Environment Parity**: Features work consistently across dev/staging/production

### **Dependencies**

- [ ] **Dependency Audit**: No critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] **Version Compatibility**: All dependencies are compatible with Node.js 20.x
- [ ] **License Compliance**: All dependencies have compatible licenses

## **Testing & Validation**

### **Manual Testing**

- [ ] **Feature Testing**: Manual testing of all new functionality completed
- [ ] **User Journey Testing**: End-to-end user workflows tested manually
- [ ] **Device Testing**: Features tested on multiple devices and screen sizes
- [ ] **Browser Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility verified

### **Automated Testing**

- [ ] **CI Pipeline**: All GitHub Actions workflows pass successfully
- [ ] **Playwright Tests**: UI tests pass for major user flows (where applicable)
- [ ] **Test Stability**: Tests are reliable and don't have flaky failures
- [ ] **Test Performance**: Test suite runs efficiently without excessive duration

## **Code Review Standards**

### **Review Requirements**

- [ ] **Peer Review**: Code reviewed by at least one other developer (when applicable)
- [ ] **Self Review**: Developer has reviewed their own code for obvious issues
- [ ] **Architecture Review**: Complex changes reviewed for architectural soundness
