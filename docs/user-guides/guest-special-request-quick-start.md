## For Baristas

### Finding Special Requests

1. **Order Display**: Special requests appear prominently in the order management interface
2. **Visual Highlighting**: Requests are highlighted to ensure they're noticed
3. **Order Cards**: Each order card shows special requests clearly separated from standard order details

### Handling Special Requests

#### Review Process
1. Read the special request before starting preparation
2. Check if you can fulfill the request with available ingredients/equipment
3. Note any timing requirements mentioned in the request

#### Common Request Types

**Milk Alternatives**
- Confirm availability of requested milk type
- Check for additional charges if applicable
- Ensure proper steaming technique for alternative milks

**Temperature Preferences**
- "Extra hot": Heat to higher temperature (be careful not to burn milk)
- "Warm": Use lower temperature setting
- Standard temperature if not specified

**Strength Adjustments**
- "Extra strong": Use additional shot or stronger brewing method
- "Mild": Reduce coffee concentration or add more milk
- "Decaf": Substitute with decaffeinated coffee

**Timing Requests**

#### When You Can't Fulfill a Request

### Communication Tips

- **Be Proactive**: If you notice a potentially problematic request, clarify before starting
