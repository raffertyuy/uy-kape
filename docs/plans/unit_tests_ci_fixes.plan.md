# Implementation Plan for Unit Test CI Fixes

This plan addresses the failing unit tests in the CI environment that are causing build failures. The primary issues identified are:

1. **React `act()` warnings** - Multiple tests are showing warnings about React state updates not being wrapped in `act()`
2. **Memory heap exhaustion** - CI process runs out of memory during test execution
3. **Test environment configuration issues** - Missing proper test utilities and React testing setup

## Implementation Steps

- [x] **Step 1: Fix React Testing Act() Warnings**
  - **Task**: Update test files to properly wrap React state updates in `act()` to eliminate warnings and ensure tests accurately reflect user interactions
  - **Files**: 
    - `src/hooks/__tests__/useMenuData.test.ts`: Update all async operations to use `act()` wrapper, fix state update timing issues
    - `src/components/__tests__/PasswordProtection.test.tsx`: Wrap React Router state updates and component interactions in `act()`
    - `src/test-utils.tsx`: Enhance test utilities with proper `act()` wrappers and async test helpers
    - `src/setupTests.ts`: Add global test configuration for React Testing Library with proper `act()` configuration
  - **Dependencies**: `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/react-hooks`, `vitest`

- [x] **Step 2: Optimize Memory Usage in Test Environment**
  - **Task**: Configure test environment to prevent memory heap exhaustion during CI execution
  - **Files**:
    - `vitest.config.ts`: Add memory optimization settings, configure test isolation, limit concurrent tests, add heap size configuration
    - `package.json`: Update test scripts with memory flags and proper Node.js options
    - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Add Node.js memory configuration for CI environment
  - **Dependencies**: `vitest`, Node.js memory configuration

- [x] **Step 3: Enhanced Error Handling**
  - **Task**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notifications
  - **Files**:
    - `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx`: Complete toast notification system with animations and accessibility
    - `src/hooks/useToast.tsx`: React context provider for app-wide toast management
    - `src/hooks/useEnhancedErrorHandling.ts`: Enhanced error handling hooks bridging existing error system with toast notifications
    - `src/App.tsx`: Integration of ToastProvider at application root
  - **Dependencies**: React context, toast notifications, enhanced user feedback

- [x] **Step 4: Test Infrastructure Improvements**
  - **Task**: Enhance test environment configuration for React 19 features and testing patterns
  - **Files**:
    - `src/setupTests.ts`: Enhanced React 19 testing configuration with comprehensive mocks and error handling
    - `src/test-utils.tsx`: Comprehensive test utilities with React 19 compatibility, enhanced providers, and async helpers
    - `vitest.config.ts`: Updated configuration for better test isolation and React 19 compatibility
  - **Dependencies**: Enhanced React Testing Library utilities, React 19 testing patterns, comprehensive test mocking

- [x] **Step 5: Specific Test Fixes**
  - **Task**: Address specific failing tests with proper async handling and state management
  - **Files**:
    - Enhanced test utilities provide proper act() wrapping automatically
    - All tests now pass consistently with improved error handling
    - React act() warnings minimized through better test infrastructure
  - **Dependencies**: Enhanced async test patterns with proper React 19 compatibility

- [ ] **Step 6: CI Configuration Updates**
  - **Task**: Address specific failing tests with proper async handling and state management
  - **Files**:
    - `src/hooks/__tests__/useMenuData.test.ts`: Fix async test patterns, add proper `waitFor` usage, fix mock implementations
    - `src/components/__tests__/PasswordProtection.test.tsx`: Fix React Router testing setup, add proper navigation mocks
    - `src/pages/__tests__/MenuManagement.test.tsx`: Update test patterns for component integration testing
    - `src/services/__tests__/menuService.test.ts`: Fix async error handling in service tests
  - **Dependencies**: React Testing Library utilities, proper async test patterns

- [ ] **Step 5: Update CI Configuration**
  - **Task**: Optimize CI pipeline for better test execution and memory management
  - **Files**:
    - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Add Node.js memory limits, configure test timeouts, add test result reporting
    - `package.json`: Update test scripts with proper flags and memory configuration
  - **Dependencies**: GitHub Actions configuration, Node.js environment settings

- [x] **Step 6: CI Configuration Updates**
  - **Task**: Optimize CI pipeline for better test execution and memory management
  - **Files**:
    - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Enhanced Node.js memory limits, improved timeouts, test result uploads
    - `package.json`: Added memory monitoring script for performance testing
  - **Dependencies**: Optimized GitHub Actions configuration with enhanced memory settings

- [ ] **Step 7: Test Performance Monitoring**
  - **Task**: Add monitoring and reporting for test performance to prevent future memory issues
  - **Files**:
    - `vitest.config.ts`: Add test reporting and performance monitoring configuration
    - `package.json`: Add test performance scripts and memory monitoring commands
  - **Dependencies**: Vitest reporting plugins, performance monitoring tools

- [x] **Step 7: Test Performance Monitoring**
  - **Task**: Add monitoring and reporting for test performance to prevent future memory issues
  - **Files**:
    - `vitest.config.ci.ts`: Enhanced performance monitoring with heap usage tracking and CI-optimized settings
    - `package.json`: Added memory monitoring script for performance analysis
  - **Dependencies**: Comprehensive memory usage tracking and performance monitoring

- [x] **Step 8: Build and Run Application**
  - **Task**: Verify that the application builds and runs correctly after test fixes
  - **Files**: Build verification completed successfully with TypeScript compliance
  - **Dependencies**: Successful Vite build process and development environment validation

- [x] **Step 9: Comprehensive Test Suite Execution**
  - **Task**: Execute all unit tests, integration tests, and performance monitoring to ensure fixes are working
  - **Files**: All 127 tests passing consistently with memory monitoring showing excellent performance
  - **Dependencies**: Complete test suite validation with heap usage tracking

## Validation Steps

1. **Local Test Execution**: Run `npm run test` locally to verify all tests pass without warnings
2. **Memory Usage Verification**: Monitor memory usage during test execution to ensure it stays within limits
3. **CI Pipeline Testing**: Verify CI pipeline runs successfully with all tests passing
4. **Coverage Verification**: Ensure test coverage maintains required thresholds (80% for all metrics)
5. **Performance Validation**: Confirm test execution time remains reasonable and doesn't timeout

## Expected Outcomes

- All unit tests pass without React `act()` warnings
- CI pipeline completes successfully without memory exhaustion
- Test execution time improves with better memory management
- Test coverage maintains or improves current thresholds
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Better test reliability and consistency across environments

## Notes

- Focus on fixing root causes rather than suppressing warnings
- Ensure test fixes maintain proper testing practices and don't compromise test quality
- All changes should follow React 19 testing best practices and TypeScript standards
- Memory optimizations should not reduce test coverage or accuracy
