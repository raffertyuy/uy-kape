# Implementation Plan for Mobile Responsiveness Issues

## OBJECTIVE

Fix the mobile responsiveness issues identified in the functional testing report for both guest and admin modules:

1. **Guest Module - Drink Selection Page**: Category tabs wrapping to multiple lines causing poor UX
2. **Admin Module - Order Management Page**: Header controls cramped and poorly spaced on mobile
3. **Admin Module - Order Management Page**: Order card content appears cut off/clipped on mobile
4. **Admin Module - Order Management Page**: Admin navigation lacks proper mobile spacing and layout
5. **Admin Module - Menu Management Page**: Menu management tabs are not mobile responsive and get truncated
6. **Admin Module - Menu Management Page**: Tab text is being truncated showing incomplete labels

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

- [ ] **Step 1: Fix Guest Module Category Tabs Mobile Responsiveness**
  - **Task**: Improve the mobile layout of drink category tabs to prevent wrapping and provide better scrollable UX
  - **Files**:
    - `src/components/guest/DrinkCategoryTabs.tsx`: Implement horizontal scrolling for category tabs on mobile with proper touch support
  - **Implementation Details**:

    ```tsx
    // Replace flex-wrap with horizontal scroll container
    <div className="w-full overflow-x-auto scrollbar-hide">
      <div className="flex space-x-2 min-w-max pb-2" role="tablist" aria-label="Drink categories">
        {/* Category buttons with flex-shrink-0 */}
        <button className="flex-shrink-0 px-4 py-2 rounded-lg font-medium whitespace-nowrap ...">
    
    // Add scroll indicators for better UX
    // Add proper touch/swipe support for mobile
    // Ensure active tab scrolls into view
    ```

  - **Dependencies**: Existing DrinkCategoryTabs component
  - **Additional Instructions**:
