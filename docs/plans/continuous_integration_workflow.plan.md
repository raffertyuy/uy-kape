# Implementation Plan for Continuous Integration (CI) GitHub Actions Workflow

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive CI workflow for the Uy, Kape! project - a React.js + TypeScript + Vite application with Supabase backend. The workflow includes automated checks, testing, and quality assurance specifically tailored for this modern web application stack. The workflow will run on every push and pull request to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
