# Implementation Plan for Drink Preparation Time Feature

## OBJECTIVE

Enable baristas to set individual preparation times for each drink in the menu management system, replacing the global VITE_WAIT_TIME_PER_ORDER with drink-specific times. Calculate estimated wait times based on the total preparation time of all pending orders ahead in the queue, improving guest experience with more accurate wait time estimates.

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

- [x] Step 1: Database Schema Update - **COMPLETED**
  - **Task**: Add preparation_time_minutes column to drinks table, update schema.sql and seed.sql with default values, create new migration
  - **Files**:
    - `supabase/schema.sql`: Add preparation_time_minutes INTEGER column to drinks table ✓
    - `supabase/seed.sql`: Update seed data with specified preparation times ✓
    - `docs/specs/db_schema.md`: Document the new column in the database schema documentation ✓
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Completion Notes**:
    - Added `preparation_time_minutes INTEGER` column to drinks table in schema.sql
    - Updated seed.sql with preparation times: Espresso (3min), Espresso Macchiato (3min), Black Coffee variants (10min), Ice-Blended Coffee (15min), Affogato (7min), Milo/Ribena/Yakult (0min), others (NULL)
    - Updated db_schema.md documentation to include the new column
    - Ready to proceed with database migration and reset
  - **Seed Data Default Values**:
    - Espresso: 3 minutes
    - Espresso Macchiato: 3 minutes
    - Black Coffee (Moka Pot): 10 minutes
    - Black Coffee (V60): 10 minutes
    - Black Coffee (Aeropress): 10 minutes
    - Ice-Blended Coffee: 15 minutes
    - Affogato: 7 minutes
    - Milo: 0 minutes
    - Ribena: 0 minutes
    - Yakult: 0 minutes
    - Everything else: NULL
  - **Additional Instructions**:
    - Before proceeding with this step, check the conversation history and see if you already completed this step.

    - If you are using Supabase CLI, follow [supabase-cli-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/supabase-cli-instructions.md)
    - When you are done with this step, mark this step as complete and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.
    - If you decide to proceed to the next step even if there are remaining issues/errors/failed tests, make a note of the issues (by updating the plan document) and address them in subsequent steps.

- [x] Step 2: Database Migration and Reset - **COMPLETED**
  - **Task**: Delete existing migration, reset Supabase database, and apply new schema with seed data
  - **Files**:
    - Delete `supabase/migrations/20250823145856_initial_schema_and_seed.sql` ✓
    - Reset local Supabase database to apply new schema and seed data ✓
  - **Dependencies**: Step 1 ✓
  - **Completion Notes**:
    - Deleted old migration file successfully
    - Created new migration file `20250824143027_initial_schema_with_preparation_time.sql` with updated schema including preparation_time_minutes column
    - Successfully reset local Supabase database with new migration
    - Database now includes preparation_time_minutes column with specified values from seed data

      ✅ **Ice-Blended Coffee order** → **18 min** wait time (3 + 15min prep time)
      ✅ **Milo order** → **18 min** wait time (3 + 15 + 0min prep time)
      ✅ **Cappuccino order** → **22 min** wait time (3 + 15 + 0 + 4min fallback)
      ✅ **Test Drink order** → **27 min** wait time (3 + 15 + 0 + 4 + 5min prep time)
    - **Critical Bug Fixed**: Applied fix for nullish coalescing operator (changed `||` to `??`) in 4 locations to properly handle 0 preparation times
    - Dynamic wait time calculation is working perfectly across all test scenarios
    - Zero preparation time drinks (Milo) correctly contribute 0 minutes to total wait time

## Success Criteria

- [x] Database schema includes preparation_time_minutes column for drinks
- [x] Barista admin can set/edit preparation times for individual drinks in menu management
- [x] Guest wait time calculation uses sum of preparation times for orders ahead in queue
- [x] Fallback to VITE_WAIT_TIME_PER_ORDER for drinks without specific preparation times
- [x] Zero preparation time correctly handled (e.g., Milo shows 0 additional wait time)
- [x] All existing functionality remains intact and working
- [x] Unit tests cover new functionality with adequate coverage
- [x] Playwright tests validate user flows
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect new feature
- [x] All tests passing and no regressions introduced
- [x] Real-time updates work correctly with new wait time calculations

## Technical Notes

- Preparation time is stored as INTEGER minutes in database, nullable to allow fallback
- Wait time calculation: SUM(preparation_time_minutes OR fallback_value) for orders ahead in queue
- UI should clearly indicate when preparation time is using fallback vs. specific value
- Consider performance implications of calculating wait times for each order
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing orders and menu items
