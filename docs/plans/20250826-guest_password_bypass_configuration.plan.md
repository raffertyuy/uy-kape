# Implementation Plan for Guest Password Bypass Configuration

## OBJECTIVE

Create a new configurable environment variable that can be used to bypass the password login requirement for the guest module. When the bypass is enabled (true), the password login screen is bypassed. When the bypass variable is false, or if the configuration is not present, the password login screen is required (maintaining current behavior).

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

- [ ] **Step 1: Add Environment Variable Configuration**
  - **Task**: Add new environment variable `VITE_GUEST_BYPASS_PASSWORD` to app configuration and environment files
  - **Files**:
    - `src/config/app.config.ts`: Add bypass configuration property with proper TypeScript typing
    - `.env`: Add new environment variable with default false value
    - `src/types/app.types.ts`: Update AppConfig interface to include bypass option
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Implementation Details**:

    ```typescript
    // In app.config.ts
    export const appConfig: AppConfig = {
      guestPassword: import.meta.env.VITE_GUEST_PASSWORD || "guest123",
      adminPassword: import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD || "admin456",
      guestBypassPassword: import.meta.env.VITE_GUEST_BYPASS_PASSWORD === 'true' || false,
      waitTimePerOrder: Number(import.meta.env.VITE_WAIT_TIME_PER_ORDER) || 4,
    };
    
    // In app.types.ts
    interface AppConfig {
      guestPassword: string;
      adminPassword: string;
      guestBypassPassword: boolean;
      waitTimePerOrder: number;
    }
    ```
  - **Additional Instructions**:
    - Before proceeding with this step, check the conversation history and see if you already completed this step.
    - You do not need to follow this step strictly, consider the output of the previous step and adjust this step as needed.
    - If you are fixing issues that arise from automated tests, ALWAYS take a step back before fixing things, consider that the test script itself might be wrong and that's the one that you should fix. Sometimes the best way to fix a script is to understand the intent of the test script and simplify it.
    - If you are running the app, follow [npm-run-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/npm-run-instructions.md)
    - If you are running any CLI command, follow [cli-execution-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/cli-execution-instructions.md)
    - If you are using Supabase CLI, follow [supabase-cli-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/supabase-cli-instructions.md)
    - If you are using Playwright MCP, follow [playwright-mcp-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/playwright-mcp-instructions.md)
    - When you are done with this step, mark this step as complete and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.
    - If you decide to proceed to the next step even if there are remaining issues/errors/failed tests, make a note of the issues (by updating the plan document) and address them in subsequent steps.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create Conditional Password Protection Component**
  - **Task**: Create a new component that conditionally renders PasswordProtection based on bypass configuration
  - **Files**:
    - `src/components/ConditionalPasswordProtection.tsx`: New component that conditionally applies password protection
  - **Dependencies**: PasswordProtection component, app configuration
  - **Implementation Details**:

    ```typescript
    interface ConditionalPasswordProtectionProps {
      children: ReactNode;
      requiredPassword: string;
      title: string;
      description: string;
      role: 'guest' | 'admin';
      bypassPassword?: boolean;
    }
    
    function ConditionalPasswordProtection({
      children,
      bypassPassword = false,
      ...passwordProtectionProps
    }: ConditionalPasswordProtectionProps) {
      if (bypassPassword) {
        return <>{children}</>;
      }
      
      return (
        <PasswordProtection {...passwordProtectionProps}>
          {children}
        </PasswordProtection>
      );
    }
    ```

          description="Enter the guest password to place your coffee order"
          role="guest"
          bypassPassword={appConfig.guestBypassPassword}

    // TO: Handle both scenarios dynamically
    
    // Example pattern for authentication tests:
    test('guest authentication works when password protection is enabled', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('/order');
      const passwordInput = page.locator('input[type="password"]');

        await passwordInput.fill('guest123');
        await page.keyboard.press('Enter');
        await expect(passwordInput).not.toBeVisible(); // Should be gone after correct password
      } else {
        // If password is bypassed, verify we go directly to the main interface
        await expect(page.getByRole('tablist')).toBeVisible();
      }
    });

## VALIDATION POINTS

- [ ] **Environment Variable Configuration**:
  - New `VITE_GUEST_BYPASS_PASSWORD` environment variable is properly configured
  - App configuration properly reads and interprets the boolean value
  - TypeScript types are correctly updated for the new configuration

- [ ] **Functional Requirements**:
  - When bypass = true, guest module loads directly without password screen
  - When bypass = false or undefined, password screen is shown (current behavior)
  - Admin module functionality remains completely unchanged
  - No security vulnerabilities introduced by the bypass feature

- [ ] **Code Quality Standards**:
  - All TypeScript code properly typed with no `any` types
  - Zero ESLint errors and warnings
  - Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
  - All unit tests and integration tests pass
  - Component follows established patterns and naming conventions

- [ ] **Testing Coverage**:
  - Unit tests cover both bypass enabled and disabled scenarios
  - Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
  - Playwright tests validate browser behavior with different configurations
  - Existing tests continue to pass without modification where possible

- [ ] **Security Considerations**:
  - Default behavior remains secure (password protection enabled)
  - Bypass only works when explicitly enabled via environment variable
  - No hardcoded bypass values in production code
  - Environment variable handling follows security best practices

- [ ] **Documentation and Maintainability**:
  - Environment variable usage documented in README and .env files
  - Code comments explain the conditional logic
  - Component interfaces are well-defined and documented
  - Security implications of bypass feature are clearly documented

## NOTES

**Security Notice**: This bypass feature is intended for development and testing purposes. Production environments should carefully consider the security implications before enabling password bypass.

**Backward Compatibility**: This implementation maintains full backward compatibility. Existing deployments will continue to require password authentication unless the new environment variable is explicitly set to `true`.

**Environment Variable Naming**: The variable name `VITE_GUEST_BYPASS_PASSWORD` clearly indicates its purpose and follows the existing naming convention for Vite environment variables in the project.
