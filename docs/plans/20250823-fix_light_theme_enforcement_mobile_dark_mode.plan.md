# Implementation Plan for Enforcing Light Theme and Fixing Mobile Dark Mode Interference

## OBJECTIVE

Fix the mobile responsiveness issue where dark theme on mobile devices causes ugly UI/UX in the Barista Admin Order Dashboard and other components. The application should enforce light theme only across all components, regardless of device/browser dark mode preferences.

## CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS

The application is designed to be light-theme only but contains `dark:` Tailwind classes throughout components. When users access the app on mobile devices with dark mode enabled, these dark theme styles are being applied, causing:

1. **Inconsistent Visual Design**: Components render with dark backgrounds and text that don't match the intended coffee-themed light design
2. **Poor UX on Mobile**: The Barista Admin Order Dashboard shows ugly contrast and hard-to-read text on mobile dark mode
3. **Brand Inconsistency**: The coffee theme is light and warm, but dark mode creates a cold, inconsistent appearance

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

- [ ] Step 1: Configure Tailwind to Disable Dark Mode
  - **Task**: Update Tailwind configuration to explicitly disable dark mode support and ensure only light theme classes are applied
  - **Files**:
    - `tailwind.config.js`: Add `darkMode: false` to disable automatic dark mode detection
    - `src/index.css`: Add global CSS to enforce light mode color scheme

    ```javascript
    // In tailwind.config.js, add:
    export default {
      darkMode: false, // Disable dark mode entirely
      // ... rest of config
    }

    ```css
    /* In src/index.css, add: */
    html {
      color-scheme: light only;
    }
    
    /* Force light mode regardless of system preference */
    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      html {
        color-scheme: light only;
      }
      
      body {
        background-color: var(--coffee-cream) !important;
        color: var(--coffee-darkest) !important;
      }
    }

    ```
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Additional Instructions**:
    - Before proceeding with this step, check the conversation history and see if you already completed this step.
    - You do not need to follow this step strictly, consider the output of the previous step and adjust this step as needed.
    - If you are running the app, check if it is already running before attempting to do so. The app runs locally on port 5173 by default. If this port is in use, that means the app is already running and you do not need to run the app anymore. Think and assess if you need to kill/restart the process as needed.
    - If you are running any CLI command, check if the existing terminal is ready to accept new commands first.
    - For example, it might be running a foreground process and is not ready. In this situation, launch a new terminal to run the CLI command.
    - If you are running any CLI command, run as a background process as much as possible.
    - When you are done with this step, mark this step as complete and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.
    - If you decide to proceed to the next step even if there are remaining issues/errors/failed tests, make a note of the issues (by updating the plan document) and address them in subsequent steps.

- [ ] Step 2: Remove Dark Mode Classes from Order Dashboard Components
  - **Task**: Remove all `dark:` Tailwind classes from Order Dashboard and related components to prevent dark mode styling
  - **Files**:
    - `src/components/admin/OrderDashboard.tsx`: Remove all `dark:` classes and ensure only light theme styling
    - `src/components/admin/OrderCard.tsx`: Remove dark mode classes if present

    - `src/components/admin/OrderFilters.tsx`: Remove dark mode classes if present
    
    ```tsx
    // Example: Replace classes like:
    className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100"
    // With:
    className="bg-white text-gray-900"
    
    // Replace:
    className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400"

    - All `.tsx` and `.jsx` files in the `src/` directory

    ```bash

      color-scheme: light;
