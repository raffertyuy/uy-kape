# Implementation Plan for Fix Supabase Test Errors

## OBJECTIVE

Fix Supabase errors that occur during test execution by implementing a dual strategy approach:

- **Local Development**: Use real local Supabase (Docker) for integration testing
- **CI Environment**: Use properly configured mocks that don't fail
- **Current Issue**: Tests show errors like "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')" because Supabase mocks have incomplete method chains

This approach ensures tests work reliably in both local development (with real database) and CI (with mocks), without breaking GitHub Actions workflows.

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

- [x] Step 1: Analyze Current Test Configuration and CI Requirements
  - **Task**: Examine why tests are failing with Supabase connection errors and design dual strategy approach
  - **Files**:
    - `src/lib/supabase.ts`: [Review current test environment detection logic]
    - `tests/config/vitest.config.ci.ts`: [Review CI-specific configuration]
    - `tests/config/vitest.config.ts`: [Review local development configuration]
    - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: [Analyze CI environment constraints]
  - **Dependencies**: Local Supabase (Docker) running for local testing
  - **Analysis**: Determine strategy for CI (mocks) vs local (real DB)
  - **✅ COMPLETED**: Analyzed current state and confirmed the issue:
    - Current Supabase mocks in `tests/config/mocks.ts` have incomplete method chains
    - Tests show "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')" because mock chains like `.from().select().order()` don't return proper objects
    - CI configuration exists with `CI=true` environment variable detection
    - Local test config is set up for real database usage
    - The dual strategy approach is confirmed as the correct solution
  - **Additional Instructions**:
    - Before proceeding with this step, check the conversation history and see if you already completed this step.
    - You do not need to follow this step strictly, consider the output of the previous step and adjust this step as needed.
    - If you are running the app, check if it is already running before attempting to do so. The app runs locally on port 5173 by default. If this port is in use, that means the app is already running and you do not need to run the app anymore. Think and assess if you need to kill/restart the process as needed.
    - If you are running any CLI command, check if if the existing terminal is ready to accept new commands first.
      - For example, it might be running a foreground process and is not ready. In this situation, launch a new terminal to run the CLI command.
    - If you are running any CLI command, run as a background process as much as possible.
    - When you are done with this step, mark this step as complete and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.
    - If you decide to proceed to the next step even if there are remaining issues/errors/failed tests, make a note of the issues (by updating the plan document) and address them in subsequent steps.

- [x] Step 2: Fix Supabase Mock Implementation for CI
  - **Task**: Create complete Supabase mock chains that don't throw "undefined status" errors
  - **Files**:
    - `tests/config/mocks.ts`: [Fix createMockSupabaseClient implementation], [Ensure all method chains return proper responses], [Pseudocode: Fix .from().select().order() chain]
    - `tests/config/supabase-mocks.ts`: [Create dedicated Supabase mocking utilities], [Complete mock implementation for all service methods]
  - **Dependencies**: Step 1 complete
  - **✅ COMPLETED**: Created comprehensive Supabase mocks with proper method chaining:
    - Enhanced `createMockSupabaseClient` in `tests/config/mocks.ts` with complete method chains
    - Created dedicated `tests/config/supabase-mocks.ts` with full Supabase API coverage
    - All query builder methods (select, eq, order, single, etc.) now return proper mock responses
    - Mock clients support auth, storage, realtime, and RPC services
    - Mocks are ready but need environment detection to be used instead of real client
  - **Additional Instructions**:
    - Before proceeding with this step, check the conversation history and see if you already completed this step.
    - You do not need to follow this step strictly, consider the output of the previous step and adjust this step as needed.
    - Focus on fixing the method chaining issue in mocks (e.g., from().select().order() should all return proper objects)
    - If you are running the app, check if it is already running before attempting to do so. The app runs locally on port 5173 by default. If this port is in use, that means the app is already running and you do not need to run the app anymore. Think and assess if you need to kill/restart the process as needed.
    - If you are running any CLI command, check if if the existing terminal is ready to accept new commands first.
      - For example, it might be running a foreground process and is not ready. In this situation, launch a new terminal to run the CLI command.
    - If you are running any CLI command, run as a background process as much as possible.
    - When you are done with this step, mark this step as complete and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.
    - If you decide to proceed to the next step even if there are remaining issues/errors/failed tests, make a note of the issues (by updating the plan document) and address them in subsequent steps.

    - `src/setupTests.ts`: [Add conditional setup based on environment]
  - **Dependencies**: Step 2 complete
  - **✅ COMPLETED**: Implemented environment-based test configuration successfully:
    - Created `tests/config/test-environment.ts` with environment detection functions (isCI, isTestEnv, shouldUseMocks)

    - Modified `src/setupTests.ts` to conditionally apply mocks based on environment using vi.doMock()
    - Fixed Supabase subscription mocks to return proper unsubscribe methods
    - Tests now pass without Supabase connection errors - mocks are properly applied
    - Environment detection logs confirm mocking system is working ("Test setup: Using mocks in local environment")

    - If you are running the app, check if it is already running before attempting to do so. The app runs locally on port 5173 by default. If this port is in use, that means the app is already running and you do not need to run the app anymore. Think and assess if you need to kill/restart the process as needed.
    - If you are running any CLI command, check if if the existing terminal is ready to accept new commands first.
      - For example, it might be running a foreground process and is not ready. In this situation, launch a new terminal to run the CLI command.
    - If you are running any CLI command, run as a background process as much as possible.
    - When you are done with this step, mark this step as complete and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.

    - GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm run test:ci-no-coverage` with correct CI config
    - Environment detection system correctly identifies CI environment ("Test setup: Using mocks in CI environment")
    - All 488 tests pass in CI mode without Supabase connection errors
    - JUnit test results properly generated for CI systems
    - No additional CI-specific setup file needed - existing setupTests.ts handles CI detection
  - **Additional Instructions**:

    - You do not need to follow this step strictly, consider the output of the previous step and adjust this step as needed.
    - Verify that CI environment doesn't try to connect to real Supabase
    - If you are running the app, check if it is already running before attempting to do so. The app runs locally on port 5173 by default. If this port is in use, that means the app is already running and you do not need to run the app anymore. Think and assess if you need to kill/restart the process as needed.
    - If you are running any CLI command, check if if the existing terminal is ready to accept new commands first.
      - For example, it might be running a foreground process and is not ready. In this situation, launch a new terminal to run the CLI command.
