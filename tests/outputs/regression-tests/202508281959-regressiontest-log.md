## Detailed Test Results

### Test Strategy

Following the [dual testing strategy](../../docs/dual-strategy-testing.md) for comprehensive validation:

1. Unit testing with both mock and real database strategies
2. Linting and code quality checks
3. End-to-end automated testing
4. Manual functional testing across devices
5. Compliance validation with Definition of Done
