## Test Execution Details

### Test Strategy

Following the [dual testing strategy](../../../docs/dual-strategy-testing.md), we will:

1. Run unit tests with mocks first (CI environment simulation)
2. Run unit tests with local DB (development environment validation)
3. Execute all linting and code quality checks
4. Run Playwright E2E tests for automated validation
5. Perform comprehensive manual functional testing using Playwright MCP

## Issues Found & Fixes Applied

This section will be updated as issues are discovered and resolved

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Unit Tests with Mock Strategy

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Command**: `npm run test:mocks`  
**Expected**: All tests pass with comprehensive mocks

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ All 810 tests passed in 70.02s
- ‚úÖ Tests correctly used mock strategy ("Test setup: Using mocks in local environment")
- ‚úÖ Fixed telemetry and performance tracking test issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è React Router future flag warnings (non-critical)

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Telemetry Mocking**: Added missing `getCategoryMetrics` mock to telemetry logger
2. **Error Handling**: Enhanced telemetry hooks with proper error handling and disabled state checks
3. **Performance Tests**: Updated performance tracker tests to reflect correct disabled behavior
4. **Type Safety**: Fixed telemetry hook return types to match expected format

### 2. Unit Tests with Local Database (Dual Strategy)

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Command**: `npm run test:local-db`  
**Expected**: All tests pass using real Supabase local instance

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ All 810 tests passed in 65.16s
- ‚úÖ Tests correctly used local database strategy ("Test setup: Using real database in local environment")
- ‚úÖ Confirmed Supabase local instance properly running
- ‚ö†Ô∏è React Router future flag warnings (non-critical)

**Notes**: Both testing strategies (mock and local DB) successfully pass all tests, validating our dual testing approach and confirming that fixes work in both environments.

### 3. Linting Checks

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Command**: `npm run lint`  
**Expected**: No linting errors or warnings

**Results**:
