In the Barista Admin Module, the search feature of each of the 3 tabs (Drink Categories, Drinks, Option Categories) has issues. Fix these issues.
1. Drink Categories: Search doesn't work, typing search words and/or changing the filters does not do anything.
2. Drinks:
    - Search doesn't work, typing search words and/or changing the filters does not do anything.
    - There is also another "Search Drinks" search bar on the same page. It doesn't make sense to have 2 search features on the same page, so remove this sub "search drinks" control.
3. Option Categories: Search doesn't work, typing search words and/or changing the filters does not do anything.
