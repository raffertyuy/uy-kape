# Mobile Functional Testing Report - Complete

## Test Coverage Completed ✅

**Testing Device**: Samsung S20 Ultra simulation (412x915 viewport)
**Application Modules Tested**: Guest Module (Complete), Admin Module (Complete)
**Console Errors**: None (only normal development messages and accessibility warnings)

## Mobile Responsiveness Issues Found

### Guest Module - Drink Selection Page

- **Issue 1**: Category tabs ("All Drinks", "Coffee", "Special Coffee", "Tea", "Kids Drinks") wrap to multiple lines on mobile, causing poor UX and spacing issues

### Admin Module - Order Management Page

- **Issue 2**: Header controls (Connected status, Show Completed toggle, Clear All Pending, Refresh buttons) are cramped and poorly spaced on mobile
- **Issue 3**: Order card content appears to be cut off/clipped on the right side - text appears to extend beyond the viewport
- **Issue 4**: The admin navigation (Order Dashboard title and controls) lacks proper mobile spacing and layout

### Admin Module - Menu Management Page

- **Issue 5**: Menu management tabs ("Drink Categories 4", "Drinks 20", "Option Categories 5") are NOT mobile responsive - they get cut off and text wraps awkwardly on smaller screens
- **Issue 6**: The menu tabs text is being truncated - showing "ries 4", "Drinks 20", "Option" instead of full tab labels on mobile
