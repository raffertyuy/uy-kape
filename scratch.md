In the Barista Admin Module, URL persistence is only implemented for the Orders Dashboard and the Menu Management (see [application_overview](/docs/plans/application_overview.md))

The new requirement is to implement URL persistence for the following:

1. Barista Admin Module - Menu Management navigation tabs: "Drink Categories", "Drinks", and "Option Categories"
2. Barista Admin Module - Menu Management - Drinks "Filter by Categories" drop down (the issue currently is that if we apply a filter and then refresh on this page, the filter resets to "All Categories")
