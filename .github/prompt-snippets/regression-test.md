Your task is to use playwright MCP to run this application locally and go through every functionality to ensure that everything is working.

See `docs/specs/application_overview.md` to know the different functions of this application.

## Rules for Running the App

[playwright-mcp-instructions.md](./playwright-mcp-instructions.md)

## Text and Fix Methodology

When the app is properly running, use Playwright MCP to navigate to the specified module/requirement. Use playwright to go through every functionality and test if it is functioning correctly.

Run these tests and fix every issue that arise.

- [ ] Run all unit tests, including e2e testing
- [ ] Run all linting checks
- [ ] Run all playwright tests

ALWAYS take a step back before fixing things, consider that the test script itself might be wrong and that's the one that you should fix.

Having said that, if you're making code changes, make sure to re-run all of the above tests.
