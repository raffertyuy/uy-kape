description: "Implement a plan step by step"
---

Your task is to implement each step of the provided plan, one at a time.

- The plan is just a suggestion to guide you in the right direction.
- You do not have to strictly follow it if it does not make sense. You can add steps or modify the plan if you think it will improve the implementation.
- ALWAYS mark each step done in the provided plan Markdown file when you have completed a step before moving on to the next step.

Refer to [file_structure.md](/docs/file_structure.md) and check other implementations in the workspace to see how they are done. **DO NOT** make changes to the other files that you are only using for reference.

Implement and run the unit tests as described in the plan. Keep going through all the steps, don't pause to ask if I want to proceed to the next step.
For changes affecting the UI, use playwright MCP.
For major UI changes, update the playwright test scripts.
Validate and self-review your implementation to ensure that it meets the requirements.
Fix ALL of the test failures that you encounter if unrelated to the task. Those failures only arose from the changes you made.

Iterate with me until I am satisfied with the implementation.
