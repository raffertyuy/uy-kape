Your goal is to generate an coding implementation plan for an AI coding assistant to follow.
Create this plan in a new markdown .md file in `/docs/plans/YYYYMMDD-<requirement_name>.plan.md`, for the requirement provided to you. You can decide on the appropriate requirement name.
For example, if the today's date is 2025-08-22 and the requirement name is "Implement User Authentication", the file should be created as `/docs/plans/20250822-user_authentication.plan.md`.

## RULES:

- Keep implementations simple, do not over architect
- Do not generate real code for your plan, pseudocode is OK
- For each step in your plan, include the objective of the step, the steps to achieve that objective, and any necessary pseudocode.
- Call out any necessary user intervention required for each step
- Consider accessibility part of each step and not a separate step

## Steps to Follow

### 1. FIRST

- Review the attached specification document to understand the requirements and objectives.
- If needed, use context7 MCP to get the latest documentation of the technology stack (e.g., Supabase, React.js, Vite).
- If needed, use playwright MCP to explore and analyze the application.

### 2. THEN

- Create a detailed implementation plan that outlines the steps needed to achieve the objectives of the specification document.
- The plan should be structured, clear, and easy to follow.

- Add a frontmatter to the implementation plan

```markdown

# Implementation Plan for [Spec Name]

## OBJECTIVE

OBJECTIVE/REQUIREMENT/TASK HERE

PLAN HERE
```

- Always add validation steps in your plan to ensure the implementation meets the requirements.
- Structure your plan as follows, and output as Markdown code block

```markdown
## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

- [ ] Step 1: [Brief title]
  - **Task**: [Detailed explanation of what needs to be implemented]
  - **Files**: [Maximum of 20 files, ideally less]
    - `path/to/file1.ts`: [Description of changes], [Pseudocode for implementation]
  - **Dependencies**: [Dependencies for step]
  - **Additional Instructions**:
    - Before proceeding with this step, check the conversation history and see if you already completed this step.
    - You do not need to follow this step strictly, consider the output of the previous step and adjust this step as needed.
    - If you are fixing issues that arise from automated tests, ALWAYS take a step back before fixing things, consider that the test script itself might be wrong and that's the one that you should fix. Sometimes the best way to fix a script is to understand the intent of the test script and simplify it.
    - If you are running the app, follow [npm-run-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/npm-run-instructions.md)
    - If you are running any CLI command, follow [cli-execution-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/cli-execution-instructions.md)
    - If you are using Supabase CLI, follow [supabase-cli-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/supabase-cli-instructions.md)
    - If you are using Playwright MCP, follow [playwright-mcp-instructions](/.github/prompt-snippets/playwright-mcp-instructions.md)
    - When you are done with this step, mark this step as complete and add a note/summary of what you did (in the plan document) before proceeding to the next step.
    - If you decide to proceed to the next step even if there are remaining issues/errors/failed tests, make a note of the issues (by updating the plan document) and address them in subsequent steps.

[Additional steps...]
```

- After the steps to implement the objective, add a step to run the app and test it against the original objective specified in the plan. Use the right tool to test this (playwright MCP, CLI, or something else).
- Add a step to write unit tests for what has been implemented. **IMPORTANT**: Take note of the [dual-testing-strategy](/docs/dual-strategy-testing.md). After testing, set the environment variable back to not using mocks.
- Add a step to write playwright UI tests for the feature, keep the test simple and focused on the intent of the objective.
- Add a step to make sure it complies with our [definition_of_done](/docs/specs/definition_of_done.md)
- Add a final step to perform a [regression-test](/.github/prompt-snippets/regression-test.md)

### 3. NEXT:

- Validate and self-review your plan to ensure it meets the requirements and is ready for implementation.
- Iterate with me until I am satisifed with the plan

### 4. FINALLY:

- Make sure the plan document ends with a new line (for markdown linting compliance).
- DO NOT start implementation without my permission.
